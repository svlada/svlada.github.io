Need a custom software solution for your business? Please send me an [email](mailto:svlada@gmail.com) to discuss your project needs.

I can help you get started and build simple and well tested solution that work, together, with your team.

The main pain point when outsourcing project is finding appropriate agency. Well established agencies are backed with sales and marketing people. Usually, you get overcharged for undelivered promises. Technical excellence is only part of the equation. Leading customer from point A to point B requires a team to be fully invested and dedicated to understanding the project needs.

It doesn't have to be that way. Working with the small team of skilled engineers is completely different experience. Transparent, honest and open process can get your poject carefully designed and delivered.
