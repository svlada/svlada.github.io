<p>Need a custom software solution for your business? Please send me an <a href="mailto:svlada@gmail.com">email</a> to discuss your project needs.</p>
<p>I can help you get started on the road of building a simple and well-tested working solution, together, with your team.</p>
<p>The major pain point of outsourcing a software project is finding an appropriate agency. Well established agencies are backed with sales and marketing people. Usually, you get overcharged for undelivered promises.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be that way. Working with a small team of skilled engineers is a completely different experience. Technical excellence is only part of the equation. Leading customers from point A to point B requires a dedicated team with an understanding of core domain logic. When combined with careful and thoughtful design, transparent, honest and open communication is key for project success.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designing software solutions for small-mid size business.</li>
<li>Maintainance of legacy systems and handling technical debt.</li>
<li>Development of custom HIPAA compliant web applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technological Expertise</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designing infrastructure and deployment processes on AWS.</li>
<li>Development of business logic using JVM languages: Kotlin and Java.</li>
<li>Development of business logic using Elixir.</li>
<li>Designing well-optimized relational model on the Postgres database.</li>
<li>Building a user interface using React.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Currently available for hire</strong></p>
