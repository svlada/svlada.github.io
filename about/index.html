      Hello, my name is Vladimir Stankovic, but I commonly use hande svlada.
    </p>

    <p class="measure-wide">
      My current role finds me at
      <a href="http://codereflect.io" target="_blank">Reflect</a>, where, I
      build software specifically tailored for businesses and startups in the
      finance industry. Much of my work focuses on simplifying these systems,
      which frequently become more complex as they develop over time.
    </p>

    <p class="measure-wide">
      I learned to value simplicity. Organising the data and code in a way that
      promises the functionality and maintainability of the system requires a
      significant amount of time. Businesses might get this, but they don't
      always.
    </p>

    <p class="measure-wide">
      Over the years, I did consuting work for companies like FIS Global and
      Deloitte. These collaborations shaped my perspective about enterprise
      environments and their inner workings.
    </p>

    <p class="measure-wide">
      My journey, however, began in healthcare. There, I developed APIs,
      established HIPAA-compliant environments, and streamlined data-sharing
      with apps for healthcare providers. I've mostly worked with Blueshield of
      California on their internal services and tooling.
