<p>Hello, my name is Vladimir Stankovic, but I commonly use handle svlada.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://codereflect.io">Reflect</a>, I build software for the finance world—tools for businesses and startups that want clarity in systems that tend to grow tangled over time. My focus is on making them simpler, more reliable, and easier to live with.</p>

<p>I've learned that simplicity takes discipline. Organizing data and code so a system remains functional and maintainable isn't fast work, but it lasts. Some businesses understand this. Some don't. Either way, it's what I do.</p>

<p>I've also consulted for FIS Global and Deloitte, where I saw how large enterprises operate from the inside—their pace, their scale, their hidden machinery.</p>

<p>Before finance, I worked in healthcare. I built APIs, HIPAA-compliant environments, and data-sharing tools for providers, much of it with Blue Shield of California. Quiet infrastructure that helped keep their systems alive and moving.</p>

<p>The best way to get in touch is by email at <a href="mailto:svlada@gmail.com">svlada@gmail.com</a>. You can also find me in other corners of the internet—<a href="https://github.com/svlada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> for code and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/svlada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> for the professional facade.</p>
