In the next six months, it’s all about setting concrete goals and executing. I’m zeroing in on a couple of personal projects, with a clear timeline to turn plans into tangible outcomes. Every goal is a commitment - the aim isn’t just to start, but to deliver.

- Create UUID library using Go
- Go + Echo + SQLC 
	- Set up a boilerplate project
	- Integrate Kubernetes into the application
- Refresh understanding of Arduino and Electronics
	- Take a Tech Explorations course
	- Build washing machine toy for kids
- Design of the Bookmarking App
- Formulate a plan for implementing a database engine
